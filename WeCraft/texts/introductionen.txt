WeCraft is not only an e-commerce system but also and particularly an information system that supports cooperation among artisans during their production of artifacts. In fact, tools are available to support the communication, the cooperative design of articrafts and for the personalization of products according to the customerâ€™s requirements.
Differently from e-commerce systems like ebay or even Amazon, WeCraft is an environment for doing other things, beyond sellings. Namely, it supports the creation of a product, its commercialization, its enrichment with elements (decorations, ornamentations and so on) that can arrive upon suggestions from other artisans who are either cooperating artisans or competitors, in a coopetition way.
WeCraft allows also to create combination of products (homecrafts + bedwares) among different artisans and possibly under the direction of a designer.
